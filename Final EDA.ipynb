    "1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding the structure and characteristics of a dataset before confirmatory data analysis  (CDA). (Arunkumar & Thambusamy, 2021).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1 Formulate questons - Providing direction for the analysis. (Midway, 2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can we use a KNN model to suggest similar neighbourhoods to Airbnb clients based on the columns in the csv file.\n",
    "- Can we use a KNN model to further suggest \"less busy\" neighbourhoods to clients based on the columns in the csv file.\n",
    "(Might need to give column names etc. But this helps set the EDA up in the correct direction)\n",

    "2.1 Variable Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing variable types and having an overview of all variables helps in selecting appropriate visualization and statistical techniques. (Dhanshetti, 2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "2.2 Data Quality Assessment\n",

    "- Duplicates: Checked and removed to ensure data integrity.\n",

    "3. Univariate Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Univariate analysis examines the distribution of individual variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Can use this to find outliers. Outliers are not always a bad thing. Deciding on what to do with outiers requires viewing them appropriately and then deciding based on context if they indeed need to be adjusted before analysis. Adjustments are done if the influence of outliers look to have a chance of skewing the results. (Dhanshetti, 2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Histograms with boxplots are used to assess skewness and distribution.\n",

    "The dataset consists of float64, object and int64 datatypes. With less than 1% missing values found in name and host name columns. While last review and reviews per month have almost 21% missing values (10 052 missing values). With the low % of missing found in name and host name, and that i dont see those columns being used to answer our question/s. I see no need to remove the data and assume they are decisions made by the host to leave blank but still legitimate venues.\n",
    "\n",
    "With last review and reviews per month having almost 21% missing values. The simplest solution is to set all nulls to zero. We can assume that places with zero reviews have not been visited before or not been visited enough to have any reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another variable i find interesting is availability_365. Investigating i found that places with 0 avaliability seem to distribeted randomly. No signs of specific neighbourhood_group having no avaliability but a few neighbourhoods like New Dorp, Woodrow and Bay Terrace, Staten Island having zero avaliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further investigation shows niehgbourhoods like Williamsburg with over 1377 or 35% of its listing that have more than 1 review but no avaliability. This concludes that i will keep all data on the above columns and not change anything. As i will be using column number_of_reviews to answer my question/s. As avaliability 365 does not determine how busy a place is as well as number of reviews. Down to the fact that palces can have no avaliability or low avaliability and low reviews. So number of reviews will be the best indicartor of a busy neighboorhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Investigating number_of_reviews. The first potenital issue i find is 4845 (around 10%) of listing that have no reviews and are not abaliable at all (0 avaliability 365). These should be removed as they are no valid locations as they are not even avaliable. These will not be able to tell if locations are busy and are assumbed to be off the market new places. Noting that i could just remove all places with avaliability 365 at 0. but the places with avaliability 365 at zero who have multiple reviews show a potentially busy place, if many of these are found in a neighbourhood or neighbourhood group they prove a great way to spot busy neighbourhoods or nieghbourhood groups. Hence i will keep places with 0 avaliability 365 who have 1 or more reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once i removed the off the market new places. number of reviews column has over 10k places with no reviews. Making it right-skewed. Showing many places have low reviews while few have many reviews. Up to 700! Indicating some very popular areas and some very unpopular areas. With outliers on both sides. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though it is not the prettiest we can see majority of neihgbourhoods have places with reviews except Fort Wadsworth which i will remove. Neighbourhood groups have less than 20% across all groups with no reviews. So data looks like a good sample to use to answer the question."

    "Listings that are available more days might receive more reviews, but the effect is minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "With reviews_per_month have a slighter stronger positive relationship. I will still stick to number of reviews simply due to being an easier metric (As reviews per month has values between 0 and 1 etc) to work with in modeling and the difference in relationship not being significant. \n",

    "By normalising (Averaging) price, min_nights, availiability_365 and then busyness (number of reviews) i can get more and less busy places that are also similar in experience. So pricey places with low avaliability are in one places and places with high minimum nights and low price are in another area. Coloured by busyness. Giving a KKN plot that can help clients find less busy places that are similar to the experience they are looking at.\n",

    "\n",
    "We can only show less busy places instead? If thats the goal. Not showing similar busy places.\n",
